# Optimize-Pro
This folder deploys the optimize-pro resources through the use of yaml files located under the ./optimize-pro/install. 
Currently all the resources are condensed in a singular yaml file called "optimize-controller.yaml".

All helm chart values/yamls under this directory has been commented out. They have been left in for archival purposes, feel free to remove them.
